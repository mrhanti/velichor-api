      "render_question": " A previously healthy 6-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of irritability and poor feeding for 6 days. He has also not had a bowel movement in 9 days and has been crying less than usual. He is bottle fed with formula and his mother has been weaning him with mashed bananas mixed with honey for the last 3 weeks. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 50th percentile for length and 75th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows dry mucous membranes and delayed skin turgor. There is poor muscle tone and weak head control. Neurological examination shows ptosis of the right eye. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n",
      "render_hint": "Considering the boy's poor feeding, lack of bowel movement, weak head control, and exposure to honey, he most likely has botulism. Infant botulism is caused by Clostridium botulinum, spores of which may be present in honey. C. botulinum produces a toxin that is absorbed from the gut into systemic circulation. This toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine from the motor end plate and thus causes neuromuscular blockade, leading to the symptoms seen here.",

          "walk_why": " Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is used in mainly treating infections caused by aerobic gram-negative rods and may be indicated in newborns as empiric therapy of bacterial meningitis. Although this patient presents with some signs of infant meningitis (e.g., irritability, poor feeding), poor muscle tone and constipation would not be consistent with this diagnosis. He is also older than one month and thus no longer considered a newborn. Aminoglycosides are actually contraindicated in the case of botulism because they may exacerbate symptoms by causing neuromuscular blockade. Additionally, antibiotics in general cannot counter the effect of the botulinum toxins, nor are aminoglycosides effective against anaerobes, such as C. botulinum, anyway.\n",

Equine-derived antitoxins contain foreign proteins that can cause severe allergic reactions in infants, and must therefore be avoided in cases of infant botulism.\n",
          "walk_but": " The equine-derived heptavalent botulism antitoxin may, however, be used in adults with wound botulism or food-borne botulism because the risk of hypersensitivity is lower in adults than in infants. They are also considerably cheaper than human-derived antitoxins.\n",

          "walk_why": " Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that is primarily used in treating some gram-positive aerobes, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Actinomyces. S. pneumoniae may cause meningitis, which often presents poor feeding and irritability in infants, but poor muscle tone and constipation would be inconsistent with this diagnosis. The goal of treatment is to counteract the effect of botulinum toxins. Since antibiotics cannot counteract the effect of botulinum toxins, intravenous penicillin is ineffective in the treatment of infant botulism.\n",

          "walk_why": " Plasmapheresis refers to the separation of plasma from blood in extracorporeal circulation. The plasma is then either exchanged with normal plasma or filtered to remove pathological antibodies, immune complexes, and/or protein-bound toxins. Plasmapheresis is also a therapeutic option for immune-mediated neurological conditions such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). However, the diagnosis of GBS is also unlikely in this infant because GBS typically presents with ascending paralysis following certain gastrointestinal or respiratory tract infections.\n",
          "walk_but": " Infants with the Miller-Fischer variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome may, however, present with a similar pattern of descending paralysis. Many cases of botulism are often misdiagnosed as variants of Guillain-Barre syndrome.\n",

Human-derived botulism immune globulin against the botulinum toxin is the treatment of choice for infant botulism because the risk of hypersensitivity is lower than with equine-derived antitoxins.\n",
          "walk_but": " In addition to antitoxin therapy, patients will also require extensive supportive care. The three most important supportive measures are: 1. Placing the infant supine with the head tilted back at 30° to prevent aspiration of secretions; 2. Early prophylactic intubation to maintain a patent airway and facilitate mechanical ventilation in the event of respiratory muscle weakness; 3. Nasogastric or nasojejunal tube feeding.\n",

The patient reports that he has experienced similar episodes over the past several weeks. According to him, the swelling would last approximately 5 days and affected the right knee and sometimes the left elbow as well. He has a history of a skin rash that subsided two months ago. He lives in Connecticut with his wife and works as a landscaper. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and warm right knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. His hematocrit is 44%, leukocyte count is 10,300/mm³, and platelet count is 145,000/mm3. Serum electrolyte concentrations are within normal limits. Arthrocentesis is performed and the synovial fluid is cloudy. Gram stain is negative. Analysis of the synovial fluid shows a leukocyte count of 70,000/mm³ and 80% neutrophils. Serologic testing confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely cause?\n",

This patient also does not represent the typical age group affected by osteoarthritis, a condition that occurs in older age (i.e., in individuals > 65 years) The arthrocentesis findings here indicate an infectious process, and the history of skin rash and outdoor occupation make Lyme arthritis the most likely cause.\n",

This history in combination with a migratory and intermittent polyarthritis in the large joints one month later should raise suspicion of early disseminated Lyme disease. The nonspecific arthrocentesis findings of negative Gram stain and leukocytosis with increased neutrophils are consistent with Lyme arthritis.

Most cases of neurocysticercosis in the US are immigrants from Latin American countries such as Mexico.\n",
